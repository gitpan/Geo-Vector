Geo-Vector
=======================

Geo::Vector is a wrapper from module ogr (from GDAL). The intended
functionality of Geo::Vector is to enable data transfer between GDAL,
libral, and Gtk2::Ex::Geo (the GUI). GDAL is used to access possibly
huge geospatial vector files and libral is used to rasterization,
visualization, and other tasks. The GUI may be used to let the user
manipulate, visualize etc vector data.

Geo::Vector is a sister module to Geo::Raster. The idea is that both
are subclasses of (currently non-existing abstract)
Geo::Layer. Geo::Layer would describe a geospatial data layer for the
Gtk2::Ex::Geo module. Gtk2::Ex::Geo is a set of modules, with which
one can build geospatially aware graphical applications using the
gtk2-perl perl bindings for Gtk+ libraries.
